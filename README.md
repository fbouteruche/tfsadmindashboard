# TFS Admin Dashboard

TFS Admin Dashboard project is an attempt to provide to administrators a tool for having a quick overview of the content of their TFS platform.

# Git / REST branch

I created this branch to toy with the TFS API so as to get infos about git commits (the first commit is a good indicator of the creation date)

I ended up creating my own TFS REST API client, covering so far Git and Builds.
